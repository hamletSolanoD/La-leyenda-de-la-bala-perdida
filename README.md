## 💭 The Story Behind the Game
This little game was born during a hackathon organized by the Interactive Media Development Department at the Autonomous University of Ciudad Juarez. Imagine creating a complete video game in just 2 days and one night!.

## ✨ What's Our Game About?
In this colorful 2D world, you control a character who needs to collect "Pan de Muerto" (Bread of the Dead) to maintain energy while avoiding cute but dangerous skulls. With themes inspired by Mexican culture, the game combines:

- 🚶‍♂️ A natural-feeling horizontal movement system
- 🦅 The ability to fly briefly using your energy bar
- 🍞 Collection of "Pan de Muerto" to recharge energy
- 💀 Skulls that bounce in curious ways around the environment
- 📷 A camera that smoothly follows you during your adventure

## 🎨 The Art and Technology Behind It
All the art was lovingly drawn in Inkscape, while the programming was done in C# using Unity. A perfect blend of artistic creativity and programming logic.

## 🎮 How to Play
It's very simple:

- **Move Left/Right**: Arrow keys or A/D
- **Jump**: Up arrow or W
- **Fly**: Q key (uses energy from your power bar)

The goal is to explore and collect as much Pan de Muerto as you can to keep your energy up!

## 🌱 What I Learned
This project taught me so much about:

- 🤝 Team leadership and collaboration
- ⏱️ Working effectively under time pressure
- 🧩 Game mechanics and programming concepts
- 🎬 Animation systems in Unity
- 🔄 Implementing player controls and camera systems

## 💻 A Peek at the Code
The game consists of three main scripts:

### PlayerController
This handles everything the player can do:
- Moving around with smooth acceleration
- Jumping when on the ground
- Flying for short periods
- Managing the energy/power bar
- Collecting items and handling animations

### SkullController
These little skulls have their own behaviors:
- Moving automatically across the level
- Bouncing intelligently off walls and objects
- Interacting with the player when they collide
- Affecting the player's energy level

### CameraFollower
A smart camera system that:
- Follows the player with gentle acceleration
- Adjusts to vertical and horizontal movement
- Centers on the player when appropriate
- Creates a more immersive experience

## 💌 Final Thoughts
This hackathon was a wonderful first steps into game development. While the game isn't perfectly polished, the experience of creating it taught me valuable lessons about teamwork, programming, and bringing creative ideas to life under pressure. I'm proud of what we accomplished in such a short time!
